The Jekyll theme **Not Pure Poole** v0.1.0 was released!

I made this blog to write like a diary. It is built on [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) and [Pure](https://purecss.io/).

For more information about this theme, you can read the [README](https://github.com/vszhub/not-pure-poole/blob/master/README.md) file.
